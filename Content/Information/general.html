                <h2>Information about Bern</h2>
                <!--<p>Here you can find some general information about Bern, the city where the STAMP conference will be held.</p>-->
                <p>Bern is not only the capital of Switzerland, but also the capital of the Canton
                    of Bern, the second-most populous of the Swiss cantons. The official
                    languages are German and French, but the main spoken language is the local
                    variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Bernese German. In 1983,
                    the historic old town (in German: Altstadt) in the centre of Bern became a
                    UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is notably surrounded by the Aare, a major
                    river of the Swiss Plateau. </p>
                <p>If you want to find out more about Bern, read our <a href="https://christianetretter.github.io/STAMP/Downloads/tips.pdf" target="_blank">tips</a> and <a href="https://christianetretter.github.io/STAMP/Downloads/booklet.pdf" target="_blank">booklet</a> about Bern.</p>
                <h4 class="feature-title" style="color: var(--primary); text-align: left; margin-top: var(--space-lg);">Sightseeing</h4>
                <p>The <span class="highlight">Zytglogge</span> is a landmark medieval tower and one of the main attracttions in Bern. Built in the early 13th century, it has served the city as a guard
                    tower, prison, clock tower, centre of urban life and civic memorial. Despite
                    the many redecorations and renovations it has undergone in its 800 years of
                    existence, the Zytglogge is one of Bern's most recognisable symbols and the
                    oldest monument of the city with a sophisticated 15th-century astronomical
                    clock. But the clock doesn’t just count the seconds. It also powers an hourly
                    performance (starting 5 minutes before the full hour) incorporating a fool
                    ringing the bell too early, a dancing jester, parading bears and a gilded figure
                    named Chronos who flips an hourglass and opens his mouth with each strike
                    of the bell on the tower’s top.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Bern Minster</span> (Berner Münster) is a Swiss Reformed cathedral (or minster) in
                    the old city of Bern. Built in the Gothic style, its construction started in 1421.
                    Its tower, with a height of 100.6m, was only completed in 1893. It is the
                    tallest cathedral in Switzerland and is a cultural property of national
                    significance. One of its biggest attractions can even be seen from outside:
                    the highly elaborate Last Judgement decorating the central portal.</p>
                <p>The <span class="highlight">Moses Fountain</span> is a figural fountain built in 1791 on Münsterplatz in
                    Bern's old town. The fountain statue was made by Nikolaus Sporrer from
                    Konstanz and depicts Moses holding the two tablets of the law with the 10
                    commandments in his left hand and pointing to the second commandment
                    with his right hand: ‘Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
                    likeness’
                    . Altogether Bern has 102 public fountains with drinking water of
                    which 36 are in the city centre; being cleaned once a week, no chemical
                    ingredients need to be added to keep them clear.</p>
                <p>The <span class="highlight">Rose Garden Bern</span> is a park to the north-east of the old town in
                    the Schosshalde district of Bern. The gardens are popular with locals and
                    tourists alike, as a vantage point with a great view of the old town lying in a
                    loop of the Aare river, featuring a restaurant and a beautiful park. The site was
                    used as a cemetery from 1765 until the Schosshalden cemetery was opened
                    in 1877. In 1913, it was converted into a public park and roses were grown
                    here from 1917. Today, 223 rose, 200 iris and 28 rhododendron species are
                    grown there. In 1997, twelve new lime trees were planted along the avenue
                    of crosses, which dates back to the time of the cemetery.</p>
                <p>The <span class="highlight">Federal Palace</span> on Bundesplatz built between 1894 and 1902 is the
                    parliament building in Bern housing the Swiss Federal Assembly (legislature) and the Federal Council (executive). It is the seat of the government of
                    Switzerland and parliament of the country. The building is a listed symmetrical complex over 300m long. It is considered one of the most important
                    historic buildings in the country and listed in the Swiss Inventory of Cultural
                    Assets of National Importance. It consists of three interconnected buildings
                    in the southwest of Bern's old city. The two chambers of the Federal
                    Assembly, the National Council and Council of States, meet in the parliament building for four ordinary sessions of three weeks every year.</p>
                <p>The <span class="highlight">Bern Town Hall</span> (Rathaus Bern), built between 1406 and 1417, has been
                    the political centre of the Canton of Bern for more than 600 years. There the
                    Grand Council of the Canton of Bern meets four times per year for about two
                    weeks per session and the Grand Council of the City of Bern every other
                    Thursday. There are regular guided tours of the building. The main building is
                    a square, three story sandstone structure. The south facade is symmetric
                    around the large open-air staircase and main entrance loggia into the upper
                    story. The upper story has four sets of windows on each side of the main
                    entrance. The 20th century renovation removed much of the roof over the
                    staircase, leaving only the centre section with its double pointed arch vault
                    which was restored to its medieval appearance. The statues which adorn the
                    clock pavilion are copies of the original polychrome statues by Master
                    Hariman of Prague. The shield with the Bern coat of arms was originally an
                    imperial eagle. The iron gates in the portals below the stairs are original
                    treasure chamber doors by Michel Müller. Flanking the main entrance under
                    the roof are the 26 shields of the 26 former cantonal districts (Amtsbezirke).
                    These districts lost their administrative and political significance in 2010.
                </p>
                <p>The <span class="highlight">Bärengraben</span> (Bear Pit), is one of the big tourist attractions in Bern and
                    features one bear family right now, Finn, Bjoerk and their daughter Ursina. It
                    is a bear pit, or enclosure that housed bears, situated at the eastern edge of
                    the old city of Bern, next to the Nydeggbrücke and the Aare river. In 2009 the
                    Bärengraben was supplemented by the adjacent BärenPark, a larger and
                    more natural enclosure alongside the river Aare. The Bärengraben and
                    BärenPark are administered as a geographically discrete part of the city's
                    Dählhölzli Zoo. The Bärengraben is a Swiss heritage site of national significance; it is of particular significance in Bern because the bear is a symbol of
                    both the city and surrounding canton, featured in their coat of arms.
                </p>
                <p>The <span class="highlight">Zentrum Paul Klee</span> is a modern museum in Bern opened in 2005 and
                    dedicated to the German painter Paul Klee. It possesses about 40 percent of
                    his entire pictorial oeuvre and hence the world's largest collection of his
                    works. Its shape of three undulations blending into the landscape designed
                    by the Italian architect Renzo Piano is equally appealing (especially for
                    mathematicians!). PauI Klee spent about half of his life in Switzerland and
                    after 1933 six years in Bern, his grave on Schosshaldenfriedhof is only about
                    200m away from the museum. In 1997, Livia Klee-Meyer, Paul Klee's
                    daughter-in-law, donated her inheritance of almost 690 works to the city and
                    canton of Bern. Additional works and documents donated and loaned by the
                    family and the Paul-Klee-Foundation and a further 200 loans from private
                    collections contributed to this unique collection of works by the artist. After
                    the decision to build the museum in the Schöngrün site on the eastern
                    outskirts of Bern in 1998, renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano was
                    contracted the same year and the building was completed in 2005.

                    many small shops. Thanks to its six kilometres of arcades, Bern is in fact
