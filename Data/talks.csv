1,"Maximal dissipative operators and squares of symmetric operators","Yury Arlinski&#x012D","Tuesday June 3 2025 - 15:25-15:55","In an infinite-dimensional separable complex Hilbert space we give abstract constructions of families $\{{\mathcal T}_z\}_{\operatorname{Im} z>0}$ of congruent closed densely defined symmetric operators with the properties: (I) the domain of ${\mathcal T}_z^2$ is a core of ${\mathcal T}_z$, (II) the domain of ${\mathcal T}_z^2$ is dense but note a core of ${\mathcal T}_z$, (III) the domain of ${\mathcal T}_z^2$ is nontrivial but non-dense, (IV) $\operatorname{dom} {\mathcal T}_z^2=\{0\}$. For this purpose a class of maximal dissipative operators is defined and studied.\\ Given a densely defined closed symmetric operator $S$, in terms of the intersection $\operatorname{dom}(S)\cap\operatorname{ran}(S-\lambda I)$ and the projection of $\operatorname{dom}(S^*)$ on $\operatorname{ran}(S-\lambda I)$, $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\mathbb{R}$, necessary and sufficient conditions for the cases (I)$-$(IV) related to the domain of $S^2$, are obtained.\\ Results are published in Arlinski&#x012D, Yu.M.: Families of symmetric operators with trivial domains of their squares, Complex Anal.

2,"Spectral theory of two dimensional Laplacians with oblique Robin boundary conditions","Jussi Behrndt (Graz)","Tuesday June 3 2025 - 14:15-14:45","In this talk we discuss a new class of Robin type boundary conditions for the Laplacian on an interior or exterior domain in $\mathbb R^2$. In contrast to the classical situation, where only the normal component of the derivative appears in the boundary condition, we also add a tangential component and vary its strength with a parameter. It turns out that in some cases this additional tangential component leads to unexpected spectral properties of the corresponding self-adjoint realization of the Laplacian."
3,"The essential numerical range for differential operators","Sabine Bögli (Durham)","Wednesday June 4 2025 - 11:55-12:25","The essential numerical range is a useful concept to describe spectral pollution when approximating a linear operator by projection or domain truncation methods.

4,"Spectral cluster bounds for orthonormal functions on compact manifolds with boundary","Jean-Claude Cuenin (Loughborough)","Monday June 2 2025 - 17:40-18:10","I will talk about $L^q$ bounds for spectral clusters (linear combinations of eigenfunctions) of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a 2-dimensional compact manifold with boundary. Smith and Sogge (2007) proved optimal bounds for the case of a single cluster. In this talk, we will consider $N$ orthonormal clusters and seek bounds on the $L^q$ norm of their square function (or density). This program was initiated by Frank and Sabin (2017), who extended the classical $L^q$ bounds of Sogge (1988) in the boundaryless case. The main challenge is to obtain an optimal dependence on $N$ (the number of functions involved). The talk is based on joint work with Xiaoyan Su and Ngoc Nhi Nguyen."

Arnold to study various model equations appearing in mathematical hydrodynamics as geodesic flows of right-invariant metrics induced by suitable Fourier multipliers on the Fréchet–Lie group of all diffeomorphisms of the $n$-dimensional torus and the Euclidean $n$-space. This method covers in particular right-invariant metrics induced by Sobolev norms of fractional order. It is shown that the corresponding initial value problem is well-posed in the smooth category and that the Riemannian exponential mapping is a smooth local diffeomorphism, provided that the symbol complies with certain mild structural conditions."
7,"Spectral properties of non-selfadjoint Maxwell systems","Francesco Ferraresso (Verona)","Tuesday June 3 2025 - 09:35-10:05","Dissipative Maxwell systems find frequent application in the modelling of electromagnetic wave propagation through conductive media. The conductor absorbs part of the EM energy of the wave, resulting in loss of energy. From a mathematical point of view, conductivity makes the underlying Maxwell operator non-selfadjoint.\\ I will discuss a few recent results regarding the essential spectrum and the spectral approximation of dissipative Maxwell systems in unbounded domains of the three dimensional Euclidean space. Under certain assumptions on the behaviour of the coefficients at infinity, the essential spectrum decomposes in two parts, one of which is non-empty even in bounded domains. Moreover, the eigenvalues of finite multiplicity of the system can be computed exactly by means of the domain truncation method.\\ I will conclude with some remarks about the propagation of EM waves in semi-transparent Faraday layers.\\ \\ Based on joint work with S.

8,"Compact perturbations of normal operators Were are their invariant subspaces?","Eva A. Gallardo (Madrid)","Thursday June 5 2025 - 09:35-10:05","In this talk, we will address the problem regarding the existence of non-trivial closed invariant subspaces of compact perturbations of normal operators acting boundedly on separable, infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert spaces. After considering the finite-rank case, we will show that a large class of such operators are decomposable, extending, in particular, recent results of Foias, Jung, Ko and Pearcy.\\ Decomposable operators were introduced by Foias in the sixties and many operators in Hilbert spaces are decomposable as unitary operators, self-adjoint operators or more generally normal operators. In a broad sense, decomposable operators have the most general kind of spectral decomposition possible. Consequently, every operator in the aforementioned class has a rich spectral structure and plenty of non-trivial closed invariant subspaces.\\ Based on joint works with F. J. González-Doña."

One can thus not expect the semigroup norm to decay exponentially in time and a more delicate analysis needs to be performed. We derive bounds for the resolvent norm (between suitable spaces) along the imaginary axis and thereby obtain the corresponding polynomial decay rates of the semigroup. This generalises a result by R. Ikehata and H. Takeda which was obtained by a different approach employing PDE analysis methods.\\ Based on joint work with A. Arnal, J. Royer and P. Siegl."

11,"From experiment to operator theory: MHD dynamo operators- some historical comments","Uwe Günther (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf)","Wednesday June 4 2025 - 15:25-15:55","The mean-field $\alpha^2-$dynamo model of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is discussed concerning the physically relevant conditions allowing for self-exciting modes. Such over-critical dynamo regimes had been demonstrated experimentally for the first time at especially designed liquid-sodium facilities in Riga and Karlsruhe in 1999. The analysis of corresponding measurement output raised the question of possibly existing isospectral dynamo configurations. In clarifying this aspect by a no-go-theorem, the fundamental symmetry of the differential expression of the corresponding block-operator matrix played an important role $-$ indicating possible structural links to operator theory in Krein spaces and physical models of so-called $\mathcal{PT}$ Quantum Mechanics (PTQM). Some structural parallels between $\alpha^2-$dynamo operators with idealized boundary conditions and PTQM operators are briefly discussed with regard to the occurrence of spectral branch points ($\mathcal{PT}-$phase transitions). In passing to $\alpha^2-$dynamo operators with physically realistic boundary conditions, the reversal mechanism of the magnetic field is sketched. For the corresponding non-self-adjoint spectral problem of a system of two singular 2nd-order differential operators global estimates of the spectrum allowed for the formulation of an anti-dynamo-theorem and a non-oscillation theorem. The conditions of these theorems have to be violated to achieve oscillatory dynamo regimes $-$ a goal which is planned to be reached in an upcoming experiment at the large-scale dynamo facility DRESDYN. The current state of this experiment is briefly described.\\ This is joint work with Frank Stefani and Christiane Tretter."
12,"Essential numerical range, essential spectra and essential norm resolvent estimates","Nicolas Hefti (Bern)","Wednesday June 4 2025 - 12:30-13:00","This talk has two main parts.

Specifically, I show that the growth of $\|(T-\lambda)^{-1}\|$ is controlled by the distance from $\lambda \in \rho(T)\setminus W_e(T)$ to $W_e(T)$.\\ If time permits, I will combine these results to derive new perturbation results for $\sigma_{e5,ap}(T+A)$ and other essential spectra under relatively bounded perturbations $A$."

16,"Higher Dimensional Fourier Quasicrystals from Lee-Yang Varieties","Pavel Kurasov (Stockholm)","Monday June 2 2025 - 14:15-14:45","Fourier Quasicrystals (FQ) are defined as crystalline measures $$ \mu  = \sum_{\lambda \in \Lambda} a_\lambda \delta_\lambda, \quad \hat{\mu} = \sum_{s \in S} b_s \delta_s, $$ so that not only $\mu$ (and hence $\hat{\mu}$) are tempered distributions, but also $$|\mu| := \sum_{\lambda \in \Lambda} |a_\lambda| \delta_\lambda \quad \mbox{and} \quad |\hat{\mu}| := \sum_{s \in S} |b_s| \delta_s,$$ are tempered.\\ \\ One-dimensional FQs with positive integer weights (that is $a_\lambda \in \mathbb N$) can be described using stable Lee-Yang polynomials, as was proven in a joint work with Peter Sarnak. Multidimensional Fourier quasicrystals are discussed in the current talk. It is shown that a rather general family of FQs in $\mathbb R^d$ with positive integer weights can be constructed using co-dimension $d$ Lee-Yang varieties in $\mathbb C^n, \, n > d.$ These complex algebraic varieties are symmetric and avoid certain regions in $\mathbb C^n$, thus generalising zero sets of Lee-Yang polynomials.\\ \\ It is shown that such FQs can be supported by Delaunay almost periodic sets and are genuinely multidimensional in the sense that their restriction to any one-dimensional subspace is not given by a one-dimensional FQ. Connections to alternative recent approaches by Yves Meyer, Lawton-Tsikh and de Courcy-Ireland-K. are clarified. Is it possible that our construction gives all multidimensional FQs with positive integer masses?\\ \\ This is joint work with L. Alon, M. Kummer, and C.

20,"Spectral theory of regular quadratic differential operator pencils","Manfred Möller (Johannesburg)","Thursday June 5 2025 - 10:10-10:40","Consider boundary value problems for (second order ordinary) differential equations, e.g., $$-y''+p_1(\cdot ,\lambda )y'+p_2(\cdot ,\lambda )y=0$$ with boundary conditions $$B_{11}(\lambda )y(a)+B_{12}(\lambda )y'(a)=0,\ B_{21}(\lambda )y(b)+B_{22}(\lambda )y'(b)=0,$$ where $p_1(\cdot ,\lambda )$ and $p_2(\cdot ,\lambda )$ are polynomials of degree $\le 1$ and $2$, respectively, with sufficiently regular coefficient functions on $[a,b]$, whereas the $B_{rs}$ are polynomials of degree at most $2$ with complex coefficients. We will give an overview on properties of the spectra of regular problems (problems with spectra consisting of infinitely many discrete eigenvalues of finite multiplicity). The focus will be on problems which can be represented by an operator polynomial $$L(\lambda )=\lambda ^2M-i\lambda K-A$$ with self-adjoint operators $M$, $K$, $A$. The spectrum is not necessarily real, but is still symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis. The eigenvalues, with multiplicity, are the roots of the characteristic function of the eigenvalue problem, with well-defined asymptotic properties$-$the direct problem. Conversely, eigenvalues for reasonably large classes then give information on the given data of the eigenvalue problem$-$the inverse problem.\\ Consequently, the direct spectral problem can be split into two tasks: firstly, to find the characteristic determinant, and secondly, to find the zeros of the characteristic determinant.\\ Hence classes $\mathfrak{D}$ of differential operators, $\mathfrak{A}$ of entire functions, and $\mathfrak{E}$ of infinite unordered tuples of complex numbers will be considered in order to investigate the following questions.\\ 1. Is there a bijective correspondence between the differential operators in $\mathfrak{D}$ and their characteristic determinant as functions in $\mathfrak{A}$?\\ 2. Is there a bijective correspondence between the entire functions in $\mathfrak{A}$ and (the sequences) of their zeros as elements in $\mathfrak{E}$?"
21,"Non-selfadjoint spectral problems related to self-similar blowup in nonlinear wave equations","Kaori Nagatou (Karlsruhe)","Tuesday June 3 2025 - 11:15-11:45","We consider the wave equation with a power nonlinearity $$u_{tt}-\Delta u = u^p,$$ with initial profiles $u(x,0)$ and $u_t(x,0)$, $x\in \mathbb{R}^3$, $t\geq 0$, and $p>1$ an odd integer. In order to investigate the blowup dynamics we look for radial self-similar blowup solutions of the form $$u(x,t)=(T-t)^{-\frac{2}{p-1}}U\left(\frac{|x|}{T-t}\right),\quad T>0,$$ with a smooth, radial profile $U$. In particular, we are interested in stability properties of such solutions. This gives rise to analyzing the spectrum of the linearized operator, i.e. to the non-selfadjoint eigenvalue problem: $$\mathcal{L} {\bf u}=\lambda {\bf u},$$ where $D(\mathcal{L})\subset H^2_{\operatorname{rad}}(B^3)\times H^1_{\operatorname{rad}}(B^3)$, $H^k_{\operatorname{rad}}(B^3):=\{ {\bf u}\in H^k(B^3):{\bf u}~\operatorname{is radial} \}$, $$\mathcal{L} \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \cr u_2\end{pmatrix}:=\begin{pmatrix} -\rho u_1^{\prime}(\rho)-\alpha u_1(\rho)+u_2(\rho) \cr u_1^{\prime \prime}(\rho)+\frac{2}{\rho}u_1^{\prime}(\rho)-\rho u_2^{\prime}(\rho)-(\alpha+1)u_2(\rho)+V(\rho)u_1(\rho) \end{pmatrix},$$ $B^3=\{ x\in \mathbb{R}^3:|x|\le 1 \}$, $\rho=\frac{|x|}{T-t}$, $V(\rho)=pU(\rho)^{p-1}$ and $\alpha=\frac{2}{p-1}$. We are interested in excluding eigenvalues of $\mathcal{L}$ in the crucial parts of the right complex half plane, which is ongoing work together with B. Schörkhuber, Y. Watanabe, M. Plum and M.T. Nakao. We first provide a compact set $R \subset \mathbb{C}$ such that no eigenvalues can exist in the right half-plane outside this set. Furthermore, we derive estimates ensuring that small discs with explicitly computable radii and carefully chosen centers are free of eigenvalues. Covering the set $R$ with such discs gives, in principle, the desired non-existence of eigenvalues, implying (linear) stability."
22,"Computer-assisted Existence Proofs for Navier-Stokes Equations on an Unbounded Strip with Obstacle","Michael Plum (Karlsruhe)","Tuesday June 3 2025 - 11:50-12:20","The incompressible stationary 2D Navier-Stokes equations are considered on an unbounded strip domain with a compact obstacle, and with the Poiseuille flow as a background flow near infinity. A computer-assisted existence and enclosure result for the velocity (in a suitable divergence-free Sobolev space) is presented, based on Newton-Kantorovich-like arguments. Starting from an approximate solution (computed with divergence-free finite elements), we determine a bound for its defect, and a norm bound for the inverse of the (non-selfadjoint) linearization at the approximate solution, which we obtain via eigenvalue bounds (supplemented by bounds on the essential spectrum) for some auxiliary self-adjoint eigenvalue problem. For computing these eigenvalue bounds, we use the Rayleigh-Ritz method, the Temple-Lehmann-Goerisch method, and a homotopy method for obtaining the needed spectral pre-information. In detail, three homotopies are performed; the first deforms the coefficients into piecewise constant ones, the second deforms the domain with obstacle into the full strip, and the third fades out the divergence condition.\\ This is joint work with Jonathan Wunderlich, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology."
23,"Computing eigenvalues of the Klein-Gordon equation","Frank Rösler","Wednesday June 4 2025 - 16:30-17:00","We construct a new numerical method for computing isolated eigenvalues of the Klein-Gordon equation with potential $V$ satisfying the hypothesis $$\|V\|_{W^{1,p}(\mathbb R^d)} \leq M \quad\text{ and }\quad |V(x)| \leq M(1+|x|^2)^{-\frac12} \: \text{for all } x\in \mathbb R^d$$ for some $p>d$. The spectral problem for the Klein-Gordon equation consists of finding a pair $(u,\lambda)\in L^2(\mathbb R^d)\times \mathbb C$ such that $T_V(\lambda)u := (-\Delta + m^2 - (V-\lambda)^2) u=0$, where $m>0$ is a parameter. The set of eigenvalues of the quadratic operator pencil $T_V$ is denoted $\sigma_p(T_V)$.\\ Based on results from [Langer-Tretter (2006)], we define a sequence of computer algorithms $\Gamma_n$, which accept finitely many point values of $V$ and produce computable subsets $\Gamma_n(V)\subset\mathbb C$. We prove that (i) if the hypothesis above holds, then $\Gamma_n(V)\to \sigma_p(T_V)$ in Hausdorff distance and (ii) if the constant $M$ is known a-priori, we provide explicit error bounds from above. Our results have implications for the so-called Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) Hierarchy [Ben-Artzi et al. (2015)]: the spectral problem for the Klein-Gordon equation is (i) in the class $\Delta_2$ if the above hypothesis holds (i.e. the spectrum can be computed in one single limit) and (ii) in the class $\Pi_1$ if additionally the constant $M$ is known a-priori.\\ The talk is based on joint work with Christiane Tretter (Bern)."
24,"How to calculate the eigenvalues of the spheroidal wave equation","Harald Schmid (Amberg-Weiden)","Tuesday June 3 2025 - 16:30-17:00","The (angular) spheroidal wave equation plays an important role in many fields of physics and engineering like quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, signal processing etc. We are looking for an easy-to-use numerical method to determine the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the spheroidal wave equation. For this purpose, an associated linear differential system with two regular singular points is studied. An explicit formula for the connection coefficients between its Floquet solutions results in an entire function whose zeros are exactly the spheroidal eigenvalues we are looking for. This entire function can be calculated by means of a recursion formula with arbitrary accuracy and rather small computational effort. This new approach seems to be more appropriate for practical calculations than previous methods, and it also offers a new insight into the spectrum of the spheroidal wave equation."

This ratio is called a plasmonic eigenvalue of $\Omega$. It is indeed an eigenvalue of $N_+^{-1}N_-$, where $N_\pm$ denote the exterior and interior Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators.\\ Motivated by the case of two touching convex domains in $\mathbb R^n$, we consider this problem on a manifold with fibered cusp singularities. In a first step we show that the Calderón projector for elliptic operators in this setting is a matrix of $\phi$-pseudodifferential operators in the sense of Mazzeo and Melrose. From this we derive that also the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator is a first order $\phi$-pseudodifferential operator. This gives us a precise understanding of the behavior of its Schwartz kernel near the boundary.\\ Joint work with Karsten Fritzsch and Daniel Grieser."

First, we establish injectivity of the spectral map $H\mapsto(\nu,\psi)$, i.e. a variant of the Borg-Marchenko uniqueness theorem.

31,"Computing the Quadratic Numerical Range","Christian Wyss (Wuppertal)","Wednesday June 4 2025 - 10:50-11:20","We present a new algorithm to compute the quadratic numerical range of a matrix. It performs significantly better than random vector sampling, the canonical method used so far.\\ The quadratic numerical range was introduced by Heinz Langer and Christiane Tretter in 1998. It is a subset of the usual numerical range that still contains the spectrum. While the non-convexity of the quadratic numerical range is one of its advantages over the numerical range as it allows for tighter spectral enclosures, it is at the same time one of the reasons that make the quadratic numerical range hard to compute numerically. We describe how our algorithm overcomes these difficulties. A key ingredient is a steepest ascent method with a penalty term to locate non-convex parts of the boundary. We also present a theoretical result that explains why random vector sampling becomes infeasible already for moderately sized matrices.\\ The talk is based on joined work with Birgit Jacob and Lukas Vorberg."
